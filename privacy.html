<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Like most other sites, your information is collected and dissected. Let me count the ways.</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>I enjoy a lovely chocolate chip cookie. However, this site no longer actively uses cookies for any purpose. This site is hosted on GitHub, which may serve its own cookies.</p>
<h2>Collection of Information</h2>
<p>This site used to collect and store login information but the site has since become a static archive and therefore I am no longer storing any user login information. Those who have purchased a copy of the book
may have done so through my Shopify storefront. Transaction information is stored on Shopify. Personally identifiable information can be deleted upon request.</p>

<h2>Third Party Services</h2>

<p>I no longer use any analytics on this site. I do use Adobe TypeKit for custom font embedding. They may create and store cookies on your machine to identify you on repeat visits. TypeKit has its own privacy
policy for how it stores and manages your information.</p>

<h2>Mailing List</h2>

<p>I used to have a mailing list that was managed by MailChimp. I have since removed that mailing list and all personally identifiable information including name and email address has been deleted.</p>
