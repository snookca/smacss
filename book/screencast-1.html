<h1>Screencast: Applying the Principles</h1>

<p>Donovan Hernandez had <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/herrrnandez/status/147416331388583937">tweeted</a> of his problems in applying SMACSS to his project. He was getting frustrated and felt that SMACSS was limiting his ability to get things done.</p>

<p>Donovan was nice enough to let me use his code as an example of how I would apply the principles of SMACSS on his project. (You'll have to excuse my dorky pronunciation of Donovan’s last name.)</p>

<p>The screencast touches on the following points:</p>

<ul>
    <li>applying a naming convention that clarifies its purpose</li>
    <li>ensuring the CSS only affects the elements it’s supposed to</li>
    <li>reducing the depth of applicability</li>
</ul>
